Wood Elf 1  
Cleric (Solonor Thelandira)  
High Forest  

**BACKSTORY NOTES**  
- I'm mentally working up some  stuff, but his name in elven translates as "spirit who watches over the shadow".  
- I'm working in an element where he hates human "civilization" but still working out if it is because his brother and him were part of a delegation that was attacked (killing the brother and leaving him for dead) or something similar, thus playing up his xenophobia and extremist position against re-establishing settlements in the area.  
details still being worked out  
- Tends to be quite vocal about membership in the Enclave and isn't afraid to make snarky comments showing xenophobia. On the road to assassinations but the good side hasn't allowed for that to happen....yet.  

**Elves of the High Forest**  
- _The High Forest once sheltered three great elven realms beneath its boughs. Many tribes of wood elves—and a few moon elves—still protect the ruined monuments to their golden age. Few beyond the borders of the High Forest know much about these elves; they have no single leader and make little contact with the outside world._  
- _The wood elf Morgwais, known as the Red Lady or the Lady of the Wood, seeks to unite the disparate tribes through the Caerilcarn ("Council of the Wood"). Her aim is to resurrect the ancient kingdom of Eaerlann, and she has made steps in that direction by allying various elven settlements. As yet, though, only a few elves believe in her vision, and they are spread far apart over the eastern reaches of the forest._  
- _The Emerald Enclave is friendly to the elves of the High Forest. However, Morgwais has a troubled history with Turlang, a treant leader of the enclave in Shadowtop Cathedral._  

**Suggested Developments**
- Featirmor has been spending his days patrolling the High Forest, aggressively dealing with threats. He lives on the west side of the forest, but is well aware of Morgwais and her activities on the east side. He has been toying with the idea of travelling east to learn more about these "Elves of the High Forest" and their Caerilcarn.
- His mentor, Rhiande Thistledew (Emerald Enclave), would rather send him the other way. West, out of the forest, to mingle with non-elves and get some perspective. He has heard rumors of the Leilon reclamation effort and is adamant that it should be stopped, and so that is the perfect bait for Rhiande to use to send Featirmor away.
- His route will take him down the Dessarin River to Yartar, then west to Triboar to pick up the Triboar Trail to the High Road, which he can take south to Leilon. He will have several stops/tasks along the way and will probably want to check out Leilon Point on his way.

**Emerald Enclave motivations**  
1) The Emerald Enclave is primarily concerned that the marshland itself (and the Mere of Dead Men in particular) will be seen as an enemy to be conquered. The ruins of Leilon are sinking into the swamp and the leaders of the reclamation effort intend to reverse that. Worse, their plan is to aggressively encourage resettlement, where the city rolls back the marshland, a deeper port is created, and the growing population is fed by a booming fishing industry.  
2) The Emerald Enclave expects that overfishing and habitat destruction will spark conflict with groups that thrive in the marshland and consider it home. There are already plans to establish a garrison at Leilon to monitor threats from the Mere, which is a step towards escalation instead of cohabitation. The leaders of the reclamation effort seem to blindly provoke the very thing they seek to avoid.   
3) The Emerald Enclave is concerned about the overuse of magic in the reclamation effort, especially in an area so savaged by the Spellplague. Similarly, while Thalivar's planar beacon has thankfully now been disabled, it should be remembered as a source of massive devastation and abject misery, not something to be repaired or rebuilt as part of the reclamation effort. Those who wish to continue Thalivar's work would do nothing but invite a repetition of that painful lesson.  
4) It is confirmed that the ruins of Leilon are crawling with undead, to the point that greater forces are suspected to be at play. While the reclamation effort already includes plans to clear the undead, its leaders seem unconcerned that they may be drifting towards conflict with certain cults and their gods, who may be bringing greater resources to bear than the Lords Alliance could ever match. Given how undead armies gain reinforcements, the Emerald Enclave hopes Lord Neverember isn't shoving an unprepared region to stumble heads-down into war.  
5) The refugees of Old Leilon (as they call it) have carved out a respectable life above some hard ocean cliffs, not far from the ruins and its marshland. They have waited a century to end what they thought was a temporary evacuation, radically changing their way of life just to remain in the area. Most of the refugees were human, so generations have come and gone... but still, they consider themselves Leilon, regardless of where they sit. Some maps had their little village listed as New Leilon (a name they accepted for outsiders, but never used themselves), but now the official maps of the reclamation effort use the name Leilon Point (a name they firmly reject). The Emerald Enclave admires their connection to the land and their willingness to live at its mercy, despite any hardship. Their heritage should be protected and their voice should be heard on the town council and throughout the reclamation effort.
